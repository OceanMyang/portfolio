          <H2>Reflection</H2>
          Through this exercise, I learned the definition of interactive
          experience and what we&apos;re doing over the course. Before this
          exercise, the word &quot;interactive experience&quot; sounds very
          blurry and ambiguous to me. The five dimensions gave me a rough
          understanding of this word, but these words were still flat
          abstractions with no content in my head. When I was searching the word
          dimensions over and over again, I explored more and more about how the
          five dimensions constitute the experience as a whole and at the same
          time uniquely identified against each other. When their relationships
          turned clearer, I think my definition of &quot;interactive
          experience&quot; became more accurate. Moreover, in creating my own
          five dimensions, I discovered the relationship between the dimensions
          and myself. I thought of my own experiences, the choices I have made
          for my life, the knowledge I had in my head, and some designs
          I&apos;ve seen and were beautiful. Meanwhile, my learning didn&apos;t
          proceed through lectures or reading, but experiencing the
          &quot;interactive experience&quot; myself and turning it into
          something that belongs to me. Therefore, &quot;interactive
          experience&quot; is no longer a blurry abstract concept in the
          textbook but something tangible, like a piece of memory, a work I
          created, or some of my thoughts I expressed etc...
